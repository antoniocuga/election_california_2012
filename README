How to use this library:

1. Install

pip install election

2. Setup a fake live CA server to test against

# fake_election_server --delay=0

3. Read the xml data from your fake server on the python command line

# python
Python version 2.6.1
>>> import election.ca
>>> data = election.ca.fetch(url='127.0.0.1:2012')  # If this was a real election you'd just write "election.ca.fetch()"
>>> data.keys()
['X12PG_530.xml', 'X12PG_510.xml', 'X12PG_510_0100.xml', 'X12PG_510_1000.xml', 'X12PG_510_1100.xml', 'X12PG_510_1200.xml', 'X12PG_510_1300.xml', 'X12PG_510_1900.xml']
>>> data['X12PG_530.xml']
'<EML Id="530" SchemaVersion="5.0">\n'

4. Drop your parsed data someplace interesting

fetch_and_upload_election_data --input=http://127.0.0.1:2012 --ssh=adeprince@dev.wnyc.net:/home/adeprince/tmp --local=/home/awesome/sauce --ssh=me@secret.lair.example.com:/home/me/woohoo

(Yes folks, fetch_and_upload_election_data does a fair amount of
threeading to hide I/O latency)
