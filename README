How to use this library:

1. Install

pip install election

2. Setup a fake live CA server to test against

3. Talk to the server

# python
Python version 2.6.1
>>> import election.ca
>>> data = election.ca.fetch(url='127.0.0.1:2012')  # If this was a real election you'd just write "election.ca.fetch()"
>>> data.keys()
['X12PG_530.xml', 'X12PG_510.xml', 'X12PG_510_0100.xml', 'X12PG_510_1000.xml', 'X12PG_510_1100.xml', 'X12PG_510_1200.xml', 'X12PG_510_1300.xml', 'X12PG_510_1900.xml']
